How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	It was much easier to find the difference

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could see all my changes and spot the mistakes faster. In retrospect it is much easier find the mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros
    	- uses less memory
    	- can mark the milestones with the commits
    	- forces the programmer to think in smaller steps and take a break
    	- let's you change more files in one go

    Cons
    	- in case of a system error substantial amount of uncommited work can be lost
    	- it's tedious to always commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    it is quite handy save everything in one go since projects usually consist of many folders and files we need to work on simultaneously

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Not sure about this one

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Everything is reversable and the branches let's you try out varoious ideas without any compromises 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I use git for storing all my projects
