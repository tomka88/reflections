When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?

I would want to create a remote repository in the following situations:
    - more people are working on the same project
    - when I want show / send someone the code I was working on
    - when I have multiple I am working from


------------------

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you want to be in control when pulling something to the local machine.

------------------

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Forks create a copy of an existing repository from another user's account to your account.
- Clones create a copy to your own local machine.
- Branches are Variations of the same repository.

------------------

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This way we can make sure that our version won't conflict with what the latest master is remotely. We can also incorporate the changes that others made while we were working on something else.
